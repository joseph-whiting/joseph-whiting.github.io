As an undergraduate I studied Mathematics at Cambridge University, taking a selection of pure and statistics modules. I've been coding for a while at home, in my course and in internships - and since graduating in 2017 I've been working as a software developer, mostly in C#, TypeScript and Angular.

I like functional programming and static typing (probably something to do with the maths background), so I'm learning Scala by using it for hobby projects.
